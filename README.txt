This is the source distribution of cinali internet downloader.

This tool was created because of thousands of web site bans issued by 
Turkish government. Since the government does not disclose the information
about which site was banned, we may not even know when what we cannot 
access at the moment. In order to avoid that I created this simple tool 
that allows you to download everything on a website "continuously" so 
you keep yourself up to date always until government decides that it's
better to block you from accessing that web site. 

In order to build you need a binary EXE of wget.exe in this directory. 
It can be downloaded at http://users.ugent.be/~bpuype/wget/
